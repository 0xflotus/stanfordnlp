There is a much faster and more memory efficient parser available in
the shift reduce parser.  It takes quite a while to load, and the
download is much larger, which is the main reason it is not the
default.

Details on how to use it are available on the [shift reduce parser](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/srparser.html) page.
