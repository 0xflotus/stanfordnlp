## About

StanfordNLP is the combination of the software package used by the Stanford team in the CoNLL 2018 Shared Task on Universal Dependency Parsing, and the group's official Python interface to the [Stanford CoreNLP software](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP). Aside from the functions it inherits from CoreNLP, it contains tools to convert a string of text to lists of sentences and words, generate base forms of those words, their parts of speech and morphological features, and a syntactic structure that is designed to be parallel among more than 70 languages.

This package is built with highly accurate neural network components that enables efficient training and evaluation with your own annotated data. The modules are built on top of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Choose StanfordNLP if you need:

* An integrated NLP toolkit with a broad range of grammatical analysis tools
* A fast, robust annotator for arbitrary texts
* A modern, regularly updated package, with cutting edge tools for text analytics
* Support for a wide range of (human) languages
* A stable, officially maintained Python interface to CoreNLP

## Installation

Details TBD, but something about pip and model download.
